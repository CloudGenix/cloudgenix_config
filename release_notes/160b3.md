## Caveats
ION 9000:

- When trying to configure bypasspairs and interfaces of type port having the same name i.e. 12,13,14,15 or 16, the configuration must be pushed in two steps
  - Step 1: Configure interface of type port first - only include interface configuration for type port in the YAML file.
  - Step 2: Configure interface of type bypasspair - only include interface configuration for type bypasspair in the YAML file

- When the source interface or the parent interface is of type byppasspair and another interface of type port with the same name exist, set the attribute **parent_type** to **bypasspair_<interface_name>**. This helps the utility correctly identify the interface between the bypasspair and port of the same name. If the parent_type is not set, the utility assume the parent interface is of type port in case of conflicts.
